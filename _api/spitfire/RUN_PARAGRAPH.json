Our team was hard at work to provide to you the best experience a notebook can offer. But this is just a beginning, a \"beta\" release, a lot of ideas are still in preparation and will come in its time. The following is an introduction to the Datalayer Notebook capabilities, so at the end you will be ready to use for your own project.\n\nEnjoy!ddd\n\n<br>\n![Eric Charles](https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/f78b756a5c0eb7dd186b6622c0afed82?s=80)\n\nEric Charles\n*Founder of Datalayer*",
